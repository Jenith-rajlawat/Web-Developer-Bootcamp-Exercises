<h1>Nepal</h1>
<p>Nepal (English: /nɪˈpɔːl/;[19] Nepali: नेपाल [nepal]) is a landlocked country in South Asia. It is mainly situated in
    the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, bordering Tibet of China to the north, and India
    in
    the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan
    by
    the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and
    eight
    of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Nepal is a multi-ethnic,
    multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official language. Kathmandu is the
    nation's
    capital and the largest city.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Ancient Nepal</h3>
<p>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had
    earlier
    evolved.[30][31][32] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[33] The
    oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human settlements in Nepal dates to around the same time.[34]

    After 6500 BC, evidence for the domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and
    storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan.[35] These gradually
    developed into the Indus Valley Civilization,[36][35] the first urban culture in South Asia.[37] Prehistoric sites
    of
    palaeolithic, mesolithic and neolithic origins have been discovered in the Siwalik hills of Dang district.[38] The
    earliest inhabitants of modern Nepal and adjoining areas are believed to be people from the Indus Valley
    Civilization.
    It is possible that the Dravidian people whose history predates the onset of the Bronze Age in the Indian
    subcontinent
    (around 6300 BC) inhabited the area before the arrival of other ethnic groups like the Tibeto-Burmans and
    Indo-Aryans
    from across the border.[39] By 4000 BC, the Tibeto-Burmese people had reached Nepal either directly across the
    Himalayas
    from Tibet or via Myanmar and north-east India or both.[40] Another possibility for the first people to have
    inhabited
    Nepal are the Kusunda people. According to Hogdson (1847), the earliest inhabitants of Nepal were perhaps the
    Kusunda
    people, probably of proto-Australoid origin.[41] Stella Kramrisch (1964) mentions a substratum of a race of
    pre-Dravidians and Dravidians, who were in Nepal even before the Newars, who formed the majority of the ancient
    inhabitants of the valley of Kathmandu.[42]</p>
